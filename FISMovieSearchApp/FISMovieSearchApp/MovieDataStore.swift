//coredata goes into datastore file, but only saving favorites with poster image of facor

//write func that gets detailed info with an api call that takes a ID string  & compeltion block as parameter, call it and pass it movie object you're on.


//movies duplicating because during pagination, instead of turning the page and thenr eading the api. must turn the page first then read subsequent pages
//core data issues- slapchat relationships for saving favorite movies, movie object is the message, favorites is the recipient
// pass movie object from VC to VC ie. movie.ID
//when done with MVP, create an additional unique feature (ie. home page populated with fandago api of current movies, animating background)
